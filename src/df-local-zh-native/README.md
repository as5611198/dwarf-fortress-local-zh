# DFI18n - Translation Mod for Dwarf Fortress

DFI18n is a translation mod for Dwarf Fortress.

**Please note:** This project is in early development. The current release is a **beta version** that may crash the game, corrupt save files, or cause loss of your game progress!

This mod relies on data files provided by community translators to function.

## Supported Versions

This mod has been tested with [Dwarf Fortress 53.08 from Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/) (on both Windows and Linux). It may also work with the Itch or Classic versions, but this is not guaranteed.

## Installation Steps

1.  Back up your Dwarf Fortress save files.
2.  Install [DFHack](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2346660/DFHack__Dwarf_Fortress_Modding_Engine/) from Steam.
3.  Subscribe to the [DFI18n](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3613958631) mod on the Steam Workshop.
4.  Subscribe to mods providing translation data files on the Steam Workshop.

5.  If you previously installed the old Lite version of `dfint-rust-cjk`, remove `dfhooks_dfint_cjk.dll` and `libdfhooks_dfint_cjk.so` from your game directory.
6.  Launch the game normally.

**Troubleshooting:** If the translation mod fails to work, try enabling "Portable Mode" in the game settings (especially if your Steam library is not in the default location).

## Known Issues

*   The mod may impact game performance, resulting in lower FPS.
*   The DFHack overlay may sometimes render incorrectly.
*   Tabs are not rendered with the correct width.
*   Some texts remain untranslated (if not yet covered by community translations).
*   Abbreviated text (e.g., `Cow` -> `Cw`) or text ending with ellipsis (`...`) will not translate correctly.
*   Multi-line colored text is not handled properly.
*   Most markup text is not yet supported (only Help text is currently supported).
*   Hot-reloading translation data files may cause rendering issues.
*   Windows backtrace frames may not show accurate memory addresses.

## Acknowledgements

*   This project draws heavy inspiration from [df-steam-hook-rs](https://github.com/dfint/df-steam-hook-rs).
*   Memory search techniques are based on ideas from [dfint/search_offsets](https://github.com/dfint/search_offsets) by [insolor](https://github.com/insolor). Search patterns were generated using the IDA [FindFunc](https://github.com/FelixBer/FindFunc) plugin (thanks to [shevernitskiy](https://github.com/shevernitskiy) for suggesting this method).
*   Thanks to [DFHack](https://github.com/DFHack) for providing the Lua API, structure definitions, and scripts to load types into Ghidra which helps reverse engineering.
